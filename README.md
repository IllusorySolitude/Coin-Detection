Introduction: 
- Shift towards electronic transactions -> Eliminate the tedious task of counting coins

- Huge array of techniques and approaches: Artificial neural networks, Heuristics approach, sensors etc.

 - Our Approach: Circular Hough approach and estimating the coin values based on circle radii
